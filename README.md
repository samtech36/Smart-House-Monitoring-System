# Smart-House-Monitoring-System

This was my final project for the Smart House Monitoring System for Electronics Laboratory 4 class


This was developed using Arduino, C++, and I2C programming languages.


The purpose of this system is to detect temperature, light, and movement in residential environments using ultrasonic distance sensor, movement detection sensor, passive/active buzzer and the RGB LED
